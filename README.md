The code designed is an implementation of a recurrent neural network (RNN) for text generation, a technique widely applied in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Text generation models are essential in various applications, including automated content creation, chatbots, dialogue systems, and creative writing. By learning patterns from sequences of text, these models can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on given inputs, mimicking human-like writing. This particular implementation, while foundational, demonstrates core RNN principles useful for understanding sequential data modelling, which is applicable in language modelling, machine translation, and other sequence prediction tasks.
Methodology:The methodology involves building a simple RNN model for text generation, starting with random input and target sequence preparation. The model is initialized with key parameters (vocabulary size, embedding dimension, hidden layer size, and sequence length), then processes each input sequence through a forward pass, where it updates hidden states and generates outputs. Training iterates over input-target pairs, computing loss and updating weights based on prediction errors, though limited to output weights. For predictions, the model uses greedy decoding to select tokens, forming a predicted sequence. This foundational approach demonstrates RNN mechanics and provides a basis for further refinement, such as backpropagation through time and advanced decoding.
